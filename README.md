# TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT

## TV Show Watchlist App

TV Show Watchlist will be a full-stack application where users can post, comment on, and favorite TV shows that they are binging on.

- The app does **not** need user authentication, and does not need passwords - only usernames. You can assume from the front end that your logged in user is any user from the database.
- Users should be able to **add shows** that they watch. These shows are shared on their profile pages.
- Users can view the profile pages of other users.
- Users should be able to **add comments** on other users' shows. Comments should include the comment's text as well as the username of the user who posted the comment.


# IMPORTANT

Please run seedDatabase.js in the front-end folder to seed the database (must have server running)
